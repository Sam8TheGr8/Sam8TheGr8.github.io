                <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>I'm Sam, a student at Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I decided to make a website to practice coding and to have a place where I can explain a little more about myself than I could on a resume or cover letter. This page provides some brief information about me, and links are provided to some more details.</p>

                <h2>Who I am</h2>
                <p>I'm a senior in college, and I wish I could major in everything. Given that that wasn't an option, I went for a BS in chemistry and biology and a minor in data science. My combination of majors means I took all the classes someone majoring in biochemistry would plus some additional chemistry and biology courses. I'm enthusiastic about science because I think it has made and will continue to make critical contributions to the world (and also because I just really find it interesting).</p>

                <h2>What I Want to Do</h2>
                <p>I'm hoping to go to graduate school after, eventually trying to earn a PhD in molecular biology or a related field. In the long term, I'm interested in working in research. My ideal job after graduation would allow me to combine my knowledge in chemistry, biology, and computer science. Until then, I'm looking to develop my skills in those areas and particularly research, ideally by working a summer job in biochemistry or a similar field.</p>

                <h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
                <p>I'm creeping up on the halfway point of college, and I've gotten to do some amazing things in that time. Among other things, I've done some research here at Calvin University, spent a summer working in IT, and taken classes that I hope will be very useful in the real world. This link also discusses my resume in more detail.</p>
